Path of Exile Loot Filter with a focus on using a lore-friendly color scheme without sacrificing visual clarity.

Item tiers stolen from [Neversink](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter).
Some functionality stolen from [Antnee](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1245785) and [Sayya](https://github.com/SayyadinaAtreides/sayya-poe-filter)
